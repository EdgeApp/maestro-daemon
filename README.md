</div>

`maestro-d` is [maestro-runner](https://github.com/devicelab-dev/maestro-runner)
plus a persistent daemon. Upstream runs a YAML flow start to finish; this fork
keeps the device session open between calls, so every Maestro command is also a
CLI command, a REST route and a JavaScript method — no flow file, no relaunching
the app, no re-attaching the driver.

```sh
maestro-d launchApp co.edgesecure.app --device 29271FDH200ABP   # ~4s: spawns the daemon, attaches
maestro-d tapOn "Create account"                                # ~1s
maestro-d assertVisible "Write these words down" --timeout 5000 # ~1s
maestro-d get screenshot -o step.png
```

The first call starts a background daemon and attaches the device. Every call
after it reuses that session, so the loop is a second or two instead of a full
flow run. Exit status is the result: `0` passed, `1` the step failed, and a JSON
error envelope on stderr says why.

Everything upstream does still works unchanged — `maestro-d test flows/` runs
your existing YAML. See the [upstream README](docs/maestro-runner.md).

## Why

Writing a flow file, running it, and reading a report is the wrong loop for
three cases this is built for:

- **Exploring an app.** Tap, look, tap again — the same way you would by hand,
  but scriptable and reproducible.
- **Agents and scripts.** An LLM agent or a shell script can issue one command,
  read the exit code and the JSON, and decide what to do next. `get hierarchy`
  and `get screenshot` tell it what is on screen.
- **Building a flow.** Get the steps right interactively, then paste them into
  a `.yaml` file that upstream runs in CI.

## Three ways in

**CLI** — one subcommand per YAML command, flags for its fields:

```sh
maestro-d tapOn --id submit --index 1     # - tapOn: {id: submit, index: 1}
maestro-d inputText "alice@example.com"
maestro-d swipe --direction UP --duration 400
maestro-d copyTextFrom --id balance --json | jq -r .data
maestro-d run steps.yaml                  # a batch, still on the open session
```

**REST** — the same daemon over a unix socket, or TCP with a bearer token:

```sh
maestro-d start --daemon api --http 127.0.0.1:7788 --token "$TOKEN"
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/devices/$UDID/commands/tapOn" -d '{"value": "Login"}'
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:7788/v1/events"      # server-sent step and device events
```

**JavaScript** — `npm i maestro-d`, one method per command, errors as `Error`s:

```js
import { MaestroD } from 'maestro-d'

const m = await MaestroD.attach({ device: '29271FDH200ABP', appId: 'co.edgesecure.app' })
await m.launchApp({ clearState: true })
await m.tapOn('Get started')
try {
  await m.assertVisible('Create account', { timeout: 5_000 })
} catch (e) {
  if (e.code !== 'COMMAND_FAILED') throw e
  console.log('not there:', e.result?.artifacts.screenshotAfter)
}
await m.detach()
```

All three speak the same protocol to the same daemon, so a script and a shell
can share one device session.

## What the fork adds

- **A daemon per name.** `--daemon <name>` (or `$MAESTRO_D`) picks one; each is
  a separate process holding its own devices, so parallel agents never collide.
  A device attached elsewhere fails fast with `DEVICE_IN_USE` naming the owner.
- **Many devices per daemon.** Attach a Pixel and an iPhone to one session and
  address them with `--device`.
- **Every YAML command, generated from the parser.** All ~90 step types, their
  fields and docs come from the same structs the flow parser uses — CLI help,
  the TypeScript methods and [commands.md](docs/daemon/commands.md) cannot drift
  from what the runner actually accepts.
- **Session state between calls.** Variables (`set`, `-e`), `eval` for
  JavaScript in the flow engine, and `${VAR}` expansion, all persisting across
  commands.
- **Inspection.** `get screenshot`, `get hierarchy` (normalized the same way on
  Android, iOS and web, with `--find` and `--compact`), `get info`, `get state`.
- **Device lifecycle.** `device list`, `device start` to boot a simulator or
  emulator, `device stop`, `ps`, and automatic shutdown of anything the daemon
  booted.
- **Machine-readable failure.** One error table shared by all three interfaces:
  `COMMAND_FAILED` 1/422, `USAGE` 2/400, `DAEMON_UNAVAILABLE` 3/503,
  `DEVICE_ERROR` 4/502, `DEVICE_IN_USE` 5/409, `INTERRUPTED` 130/499.
- **Events.** Server-sent events for every step and device transition, resumable
  with `Last-Event-ID`.

And everything upstream already gives it: Android via UIAutomator2 or the
DeviceLab on-device driver, iOS simulators **and physical devices** via
WebDriverAgent, desktop browsers via CDP, cloud grids via Appium, React Native
and Flutter element finding, HTML/JUnit/Allure reports, and a single binary with
no JVM.

## Install

**From source** — Go 1.23+, installs next to maestro-runner and shares its
drivers and caches:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EdgeApp/maestro-d
cd maestro-d && make build            # → ~/.maestro-runner/bin/maestro-d
export PATH="$HOME/.maestro-runner/bin:$PATH"
```

**From a release** — each platform tarball is a self-contained home
(`bin/maestro-d`, `drivers/`):

```sh
V=0.1.0; T=darwin-arm64                      # or darwin-x64, linux-arm64, linux-x64
mkdir -p ~/.maestro-runner
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/EdgeApp/maestro-d/releases/download/maestro-d-v$V/maestro-d-$T-$V.tgz" \
  | tar xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.maestro-runner
```

Then check the toolchain and see what is plugged in:

```sh
maestro-d doctor
maestro-d devices
```

Android testing needs `adb`; iOS needs Xcode's command-line tools (and
`--team-id` for physical devices); web testing needs Chrome or Chromium.
